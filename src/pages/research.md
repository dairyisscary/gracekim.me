Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork I conducted in the United States and Italy, my dissertation asks how scientists today are developing new technologies for the restoration of artworks and cultural heritage. In particular, I am interested in how physicists, chemists, and biologists can bring their varied perspectives on &ldquo;nature&rdquo; to bear on what &ldquo;original&rdquo; or &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; art and heritage should look like.

My dissertation argues that scientists today use their laboratory expertise to transform objects that have canonically been the domain of history and aesthetics into objects of technoscience. I show how technology now is enlisted as a mode of authenticity&rsquo;s material production, as scientists use high-tech practices to return aura to deteriorated artifacts. Scientists are contributing to enduring ethical debates within art history and heritage preservation, having to do with interpreting an artist’s intent and an object’s historicity or pristineness.

My case studies include:
  1. Harvard&rsquo;s restoration of paintings by Mark Rothko by way of digital light projection;
  2. The development of nanotechnology by physical chemists in Florence, Italy to restore modern and contemporary art;
  3. And, a microbiology laboratory in Milan, Italy where scientists train bacteria to metabolize the dark crusts on stone monuments.
  4. My last case study in the Vatican Museums analyzes my fieldwork in the Vatican&rsquo;s Ethnological Museum, where conservators, charged with the heritage of &ldquo;non-Western&rdquo; cultures, must interpret the figure of &ldquo;the other.&rdquo;

I have had the pleasure of speaking at my high school, the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, in their TEDx conference. Drawing on the conference&rsquo;s theme of &ldquo;Growth,&rdquo; I reminisce about my path from an aspiring teen neurobiologist who once poked the neurons of sea slugs to an anthropologist who studies the material practices of cultural memory.
