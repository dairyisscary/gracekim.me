I am a [PhD candidate in MIT&apos;s Graduate Program in History | Anthropology | Science, Technology, and Society](http://web.mit.edu/hasts/graduate/kim.html). Focusing on materiality and expertise, I am a cultural anthropologist who studies the intersections of artworks, cultural heritage, and technoscience.

Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork I conducted in the United States and Italy, my dissertation asks how scientists today are developing new technologies for the restoration of artworks and cultural heritage. In particular, I am interested in how physicists, chemists, and biologists can bring their varied perspectives on &ldquo;nature&rdquo; to bear on what &ldquo;original&rdquo; or &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; art and heritage should look like.
